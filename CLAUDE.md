# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

A two-stage Markdown-to-Confluence documentation pipeline. The two stages are **fully independent** and share only the on-disk Markdown doc set as their interface:

1. **Generate** (no code in this repo runs it) — a human points Claude Code at a target repo plus `template.yaml`, and Claude writes a numbered Markdown doc set. `template.yaml` is the *spec/contract* the generator follows; `GUIDE.md` holds the prompt and walkthrough. Nothing here executes this stage — it is prompt-driven.
2. **Publish** — `confluence_publish.py` uploads that doc set to Confluence Cloud as a page tree under one parent page.

The Markdown is the source of truth; Confluence is a derived, re-publishable view. Edits should preserve that direction (e.g. `--prefix` namespaces titles at publish time *only*, never mutating the Markdown).

## Commands

```bash
# Load credentials (never committed) into the shell
cp .env.example .env       # then edit: CONFLUENCE_BASE_URL (ends in /wiki), CONFLUENCE_EMAIL, CONFLUENCE_API_TOKEN
set -a; . ./.env; set +a

# Always dry-run first — resolves the CREATE/UPDATE plan and writes nothing
python3 confluence_publish.py DOCS_DIR --space KEY --parent PAGE_ID --prefix REPO --dry-run

# Publish for real
python3 confluence_publish.py DOCS_DIR --space KEY --parent PAGE_ID --prefix REPO
```

- `--space` is the **key** (e.g. `ENG`, or `~yourname` for a personal space), resolved to a numeric space id at runtime.
- `--parent` must be a real **page** id, never a folder — the v2 API does not reliably publish under folders.
- `--prefix` is required in practice when several repos share one space, because Confluence titles must be unique *within a space*.
- `--img-dir` overrides where Mermaid PNGs are rendered; it defaults to `<docs_dir>/.img` (gitignored, regenerated each publish).

There is **no build, no linter, no test suite, and no dependency install** — pure Python 3.9+ standard library. The only external runtime dependency is `npx`/Node (for `@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli`), used solely to render Mermaid to PNG; without it diagrams fall back to a styled code block. Target Python 3.9 specifically (the `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of both modules exists so `X | None` / `tuple[...]` annotations parse on 3.9).

## Architecture: the conversion pipeline

The publish path is the whole codebase. Understanding it requires reading both modules together:

- **`md_to_confluence.py`** — a library of pure functions that turn Obsidian-style Markdown into *generic* HTML (headings, lists, tables, blockquotes, callouts, code, Mermaid). It knows nothing about Confluence's REST API.
- **`confluence_publish.py`** — the CLI. It loads `md_to_confluence.py` dynamically via `importlib` (as `mdc`), then **post-processes** the generic HTML into valid Confluence *storage format* (the XHTML-with-macros dialect Confluence stores), and handles all REST calls.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- The split is deliberate: `mdc` produces vanilla HTML; `confluence_publish` upgrades it to Confluence storage XHTML (code → `ac:structured-macro`, callouts → colored panels, `<img>` → `ac:image` attachments, `[[wikilinks]]` → `ac:link`). Keep Confluence-specific markup out of `md_to_confluence.py`.
- `confluence_publish.py` imports `md_to_confluence.py` by file path with `importlib`, not a normal `import`, so the two files must sit side by side (`HERE / "md_to_confluence.py"`). Moving or renaming either breaks the load.
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`

### The transform ordering in `md_to_storage()` is load-bearing

`md_to_storage()` (in `confluence_publish.py`) is the heart of the conversion, and its step order is not arbitrary — several steps depend on running before/after others:

1. `_extract_wikilinks` **before** conversion — the bulk converter (`mdc.convert_wikilinks`) would otherwise *flatten* `[[links]]` to plain text. They are swapped for `xLINKNx` tokens and restored as `ac:link` markup at the end.
2. `_extract_callouts` **before** conversion — Obsidian callouts become `xCALLOUTNx` placeholder paragraphs, converted to panel macros and swapped back in after.
3. Mermaid `<img>` → attachments, then autolink + bare-`&` escaping.
4. `_code_blocks_to_macro` runs **last**, because it emits `CDATA` sections that the ampersand-escaping step must not touch.
5. `validate_storage()` parses the final body as XML before anything is sent — malformed content fails locally rather than producing a broken Confluence page.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- This is a token-masking strategy: anything that must survive HTML conversion or escaping is pulled out, replaced with an inert sentinel (`xLINKNx`, `xCALLOUTNx`, or `\x00N\x00` inside `process_inline`), then restored last. If you add a new transform, decide explicitly where it sits relative to escaping and CDATA generation.
- `process_inline()` in `md_to_confluence.py` uses the same idea at the inline level — it masks code spans and links *before* applying emphasis/escaping so stray `*` or `<` inside code can't create crossing/invalid tags.
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`

### A shared-mutable-state gotcha

Mermaid rendering is driven by **module-level globals** in `md_to_confluence.py`: `_current_img_dir` and `_current_img_rel`. `md_to_storage()` sets them before calling `convert_markdown_to_html()` and restores them in a `finally`. They are not parameters. If you refactor rendering, preserve this save/restore discipline or concurrent/repeat calls will render diagrams to the wrong place (or not at all).

### Publishing semantics

- **Idempotency is by exact title match**, not a stored page map. `find_page_id_by_title` pages through *all* results (following `_links.next`), so re-publishing reliably UPDATEs rather than spuriously CREATEs. Re-running after editing Markdown is safe.
- **Never deletes; only creates/updates under the `--parent` you pass.** This is the core safety property — do not add deletion without an explicit opt-in flag (a `--prune` is listed as a deliberately-unimplemented future option).
- **Layout:** top-level `NN - Title.md` files become children of the parent; an `In Situ/` subfolder (matched case-insensitively via `find_insitu_dir`) becomes an `In Situ` container page with the deep-dives beneath it.
- **Attachments** (rendered Mermaid PNGs) are content-hash-named and uploaded only *after* the page exists; `existing_attachment_names` skips names already present, since re-uploading a duplicate filename returns HTTP 400.
- **Pre-flight duplicate check:** `main()` rejects a doc set with two files resolving to the same title *before* contacting Confluence, naming the colliding files.
- REST uses the **v2 API** for pages/spaces/attachments-listing, but the **v1 endpoint** for attachment *upload* (multipart). `_req` stashes Confluence's real error body on `HTTPError.detail` so `main()` can print the actual reason (v2's bare "HTTP Error 400" otherwise hides it).

## Conventions worth knowing (from `template.yaml`)

These shape the Markdown the publisher consumes, so they matter when debugging "why didn't this render/link":

- Filenames are `NN - Title.md` with gap-free numbering; `00 - Index.md` is generated last.
- Cross-links to numbered docs use the **full** `[[NN - Title]]` form — a bare `[[Title]]` renders as unresolved in Obsidian. Only unnumbered In Situ docs are linked bare.
- H2 section headings are **unnumbered plain text**, because the literal heading text is the cross-link anchor.
- `#heading` anchors in wikilinks are currently **dropped** on publish (`_extract_wikilinks`) — the link lands on the page, not the heading. Confluence uses a different anchor scheme; this is a known limitation, not a bug to "fix" casually.
- Mermaid labels must avoid `( ) : ; , # & " ' < > { } [ ]` unquoted (Obsidian's parser is strict); the `mermaid:` block in `template.yaml` has the full rules.

## Operational gotchas

- **macOS `ssl.SSLCertVerificationError: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` on publish.** Affects the **python.org** Python build (Apple's `/usr/bin/python3` is fine), which ships a CA bundle that isn't installed by default. Fix once by running the bundled `/Applications/Python 3.x/Install Certificates.command` (or `pip install --upgrade certifi` for that interpreter). Do **not** work around it by disabling certificate verification — that removes the security the check provides. See README troubleshooting.
- **A `400` only ever surfaces on the real publish, never on `--dry-run`** (the dry-run never exercises the write path). The usual causes are a duplicate title in the space (use a distinct `--prefix`) or a `--parent` that is a folder, or a page in a different space than `--space`.
